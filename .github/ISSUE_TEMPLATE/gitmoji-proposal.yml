        We are trying to always describe/categorize "what" has been done in a particular commit, not the "how" it was done (the exceptions being :poop: and :beers:).

        Notice here that, by the descriptions on the "how" category, you can't know what has been achieved in the commit.

        | Examples of "what" commits                    | Examples of "how" commits                         |
        | --------------------------                    | -------------------------                         |
        | :white_check_mark: Add, update, or pass tests | :hankey: Write bad code that needs to be improved |
        | :lock: Fix security or privacy issues         | :beers: Write code drunkenly                      |
        | :zap: Improve performance                     | :robot: Write an automated commit by a script     |
