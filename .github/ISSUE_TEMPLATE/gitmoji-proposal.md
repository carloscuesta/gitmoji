would use this emoji:
<!-- explanation right below this line -->

### Can't this use case be covered by another emoji?

> Can't this use case be covered by another emoji? Try thinking about what
> other existing emojis work similar to this and describe what are the
> differences between those similar ones and this proposed one.
<!-- answer right below this line -->

### Does this emoji fall into the "how" category?

> We are trying to always describe/categorize the "what" has been done in one
> particular commit (:white_check_mark:, :lock:, :zap:...), not the "how" it was
> done (the exceptions being :hankey:, :beers:). Does this emoji fall into the
> "how" category? If that's the case we are probably gonna reject the idea, but
> if you still think this one should be included, please spend some extra time
> defending this aspect as well;
