Hello @carloscuesta :sunglasses:!

<!-- Emoji suggestion: Use this template to propose an emoji -->

- Emoji: :rainbow: <!-- Emoji icon you want to use -->
- Code: `:rainbow:` <!-- Emoji code on GitHub -->
- Description: <!-- Create a short description of the new emoji to appear on the emoji cards -->

<!--
Justify the creation of this emoji, while you write this, try to thing about
the following questions:

- Can't this use case be covered by another emoji? If maybe we can use another
  emoji for this, what's the difference between the other emojis?

- We are trying to always describe/categorize the "what" has been done in one
  particular commit (:white_check_mark:, :lock:, :zap:...), not the "how" it
  was done (the exceptions being :hankey:, :beers:). Does this emoji fall into
  the "how" category? If that's the case we are probably gonna reject the idea,
  but if you still think this one should be an inclusion, please spend some
  extra time defending this aspect as well;
-->
