Hello @carloscuesta :sunglasses:!

<!-- Emoji suggestion: Use this template to propose an emoji -->

- Emoji: :rainbow: <!-- Emoji icon you want to use -->
- Code: `:rainbow:` <!-- Emoji code on GitHub -->
- Description: <!-- Create a short description of the new emoji to appear on the emoji cards -->

## Describe the use case of your emoji

<!-- Explain the creation of this emoji, what this is and when it should be used -->

### Is this use case covered by an existing emoji?

<!--
Can we cover this use case with an existing emoji? Try thinking about what
other existing emojis work similar to this and describe what are the
differences between those similar ones and this proposed one.
-->

### Does this emoji fall into the "how" category?

<!--
We are trying to always describe/categorize the "what" has been done in one
particular commit (:white_check_mark:, :lock:, :zap:...), not the "how" it was
done (the exceptions being :hankey:, :beers:). Does this emoji fall into the
"how" category?
-->

### Examples

<!--
Include some examples for using the emoji
-->
